# Q2TetrisAI
This is not a working progress but rather it is a work-in-progress.
Quest to Tetris AI

This project is started with the intentions to understand Q-based learning using Tetris as a game example for the agent to learn.

As part of my fascination towards automation, AI, as well as machine learning. I have started this lengthy project to understand how reinforcement learning adapts and affects gameplay using tetris as a test environment. 

Current progress: 
- pygame to create game window, score, preview.
- established a game box
- added shapes in tsettings.py

TO-DO:
- establish grid like in real tetris game.
- add a way to control pieces (move left, right, rotate, drop)
- game to auto clear when line is complete (follow up with how to calculate points based on number of cleared lines in a row >> display onto score window)
- find a way to combine tscore.py and tpreview.py into 1 file 

If anyone would like to share their understanding, help me understand further, as well as interest to work with me on this project. Please feel free to let me know. 
Codes will be updated periodically once I have progress in my test environment.
